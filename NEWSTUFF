function-scope static variables names get swizzled to <variable><integer>, no leading underscore, where integer is tracked per file
file-scope static variables become <variable>, no underscore
static function names get <funcname>, no underscore

no hash needed.

static int foo = 0; becomes foo .dw 0

static bar() {
	static int foo = 0;
	static char xx;
}

becomes:

.data
foo0: .dw 0
.bss
xx1: .ds 1
.text
bar: ... <code> ret

	labels inside bar are Lbar0... etc
