# Self-Parse Milestone

**Date**: January 2025
**Tag**: self-parse

The ccc compiler (pass 1) achieved **100% self-hosting** - it parses all 18 of its own source files without errors and generates correct AST output.

**Status**: 18/18 files, ~4,600 lines of C code, 134 tests passing, 0 parse errors

Run `make testself` to verify self-hosting capability.
