; dup system call
;
; dup(fd)
;
; Takes a file descriptor previously returned by open,
; creat, or pipe and allocates a new descriptor synonymous
; with the original. Subsequent reads or writes with the
; new descriptor will have exactly the same effect as the
; same call with the old descriptor.
;
; Since the algorithm returns the lowest available value,
; combinations of dup and close can be used to move file
; descriptors. This is used mostly for manipulating stdin
; (fd 0) and stdout (fd 1).
;
; returns -1 on error, else new file descriptor
