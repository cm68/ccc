verify that nested macros work.

#define	FOO(x,y)	bar(x,y)
#define	XYZZY(a,b)	FOO(a,FOO(b,a))

to maybe to shrink the lexer a bit
make a bitmap with 128 entries:
0x01 - is a character that may start a symbol name
0x02 - is a character internal to a symbol name
0x04 - is whitespace
0x10 - is an operator
0x20 - is an += kind of operator
0x40 - is an ++ kind of operator
